Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading.

With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world\u2019s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was \u201cdiscovered\u201d by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit).

The reason: it clearly transcends the pleasantly mellow limits of the classic Kona profile. It displayed power, complexity, and an uncompromising, authoritative acidity, laid right on top of the usual soft, brightly sweet virtues of a typical Kona. Even the Kona-bashers on the panel liked this coffee. (Well, all but one.) Nobody raved, but there were lots of approving noises: \"excellent,\" \"very interesting, very clean on the palate,\" \"nice depth.\" However, this excellent coffee might be too authoritative for those who like to slip into the softness of a more typical Kona. Lovers of Kona's sweeter, gentler side may prefer one of the less acidy profiles like the Guyer, Hamasaki, or Bayview Farms mill selections. The rather powerful acidity of this coffee casts doubt on the specialty coffee truism that only high growing altitudes (usually defined as over 4,000 feet) can produce solidly acidy coffees. The average elevation of the Fitzgerald Estate is around 1,600 feet. Apparently microclimate can mimic the conditions that, at higher altitudes, produce acidy profiles.","notes":"This excellent coffee transcends the limits of the classic, soft Kona profile, displaying power, complexity and an uncompromising, authoritative acidity.

With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety of Arabica continues to distinguish itself as one of the world\u2019s rarest and most unique coffees. Although the Gesha originated in Ethiopia, it was \u201cdiscovered\u201d by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It was grown in western Ethiopia by farmers Adam and Rachel Overton and their indigenous Meanit culture collaborators from seed selected from wild trees in the nearby Gori Gesha forest. This is a dry-processed or \u201cnatural\u201d version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the soft fruit residue has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or \u201cwashed\u201d coffees.
