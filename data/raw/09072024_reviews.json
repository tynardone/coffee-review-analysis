This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It was grown in western Ethiopia by farmers Adam and Rachel Overton and their indigenous Meanit culture collaborators from seed selected from wild trees in the nearby Gori Gesha forest.

        "blind_assessment": "Fruit- and cocoa-toned. Raspberry, cocoa nib, thyme, cedar, agave syrup in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with even-keeled acidity; plush, very syrupy mouthfeel. Jammy, herbaceous finish.",
        "notes": "Produced by smallholding farmers surrounding Huye Mountain Washing Station, entirely of the Red Bourbon variety of Arabica, and processed by the traditional washed method (fruit skin and flesh are removed from the beans before they are dried). JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums.

        "bottom_line": "A confident, familiar, satisfying Rwanda with notes of red berry up front, complicated by pleasing bittersweet citrus and crisp cocoa nib throughout.",
