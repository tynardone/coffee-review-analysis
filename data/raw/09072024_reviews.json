Monsooning turns the beans puffily yellow, reduces the dry, acidy sensation, increases body, and often adds an earthy mildewed flavor to the fruity character of the original beans. Despite the words \"Medium Roast\" in the coffee name, this sample was rather dark roasted for a Monsooned coffee, a coffee type that is usually brought to a lighter roast.
