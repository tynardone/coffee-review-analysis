Eugenioides is a species of coffee that botanists believe spontaneously crossed with Robusta to create the Arabica species 10,000 to 25,000 years ago. Over the last few years some farms have experimented with producing small volumes of pure Eugenioides. Marked by great sweetness coupled with often savory-leaning complexity, Eugenioides can produce an original and striking cup. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed.

96,Temple Coffee and Tea,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Reko,"Delicate, intricate, refined. Lychee, pink peppercorn, candied ginseng, jasmine, honey in aroma and cup. Lyrical, complex, balanced acidity; juicy, silky mouthfeel. The finish, saturated with sweet and spicy tones (lychee, pink peppercorn), is resonant in the short and elegant in the long, where candied ginseng reappears and an intriguing coconut note surfaces.","This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 4 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2016. Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Yirgacheffe coffees like this one processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying) typically express great aromatic complexity and intensity with a particular emphasis on citrus and floral notes. Like virtually all coffees from southern Ethiopia, this coffee is most likely produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops.

88,Kura Java Coffee,Organic Toraja,"A coffee whose uncompromisingly earthy character requires the same reorientation of conventional taste as do peaty malt whiskies. Distinct moist fallen leaf notes in the aroma with hints of sweet fruit ferment that with some imagination read as chocolate. In the cup the fallen leaf tones turn distinctly humus-like with continued hints of a sort of fermented chocolate. Medium body, syrupy mouthfeel. The chocolate notes persist in the finish, softening and complicating a hardish astringency.","An eight-year aged coffee originating in the Toraja growing region of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Aging only intensifies the genius of this gloriously primitive coffee. The distributor calls this coffee ""organic,"" but cites no certifications. Most likely it is de facto organic - over the years the growers were too poor or too traditional in their agricultural practices to even consider adding chemicals to their fields. Kura Java coffee is the product of a company devoted to retailing a variety of Indonesian products, including art, jewelry, books and coffee.
