Suggests UMAP over t-SNE

t-SNE embeddings are not stable, and can be different each time you run it.

UMAP before HDBSCAN is not unreasonable.

Dimensionality Reduction
2 main types:
    1. Matrix Factorization
        PCA, Linear Autoencoders, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Generalized Matrix Factorization, Word2Vec, GloVe, etc.
    2. Neighbor Graphs
        Laplacian Eigenmaps, Hessian Eigenmaps, Isomap, t-SNE, UMAP, JSE, locally linear embedding, etc.

PCA is prototypical matrix factorization method. Interpretable, but not great for non-linear data.

t-SNE is state of the art for neighbor graph methods.
